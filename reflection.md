- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the addResident method in the House class which allowed the House class to handle different scenarios when adding residents, either ading a single resident at a time or adding multiple residents in one go. I overloaded similar methods in Library and Cafe, addTitle & removeTitle in Library and sellCoffee & restock in Cafe. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
So once I actually sat down and started coding, it went mostly fine. However, I have not really had a coherant thought since Tuesday (thank you election) so actually doing the coding was a struggle. To future students, not having a major election will probably make this project much easier.
